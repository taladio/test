# Copilot Instructions for tudonghoacode

## Project Overview
This is a simple Python learning project containing basic programming exercises in Vietnamese. The codebase consists of individual Python scripts demonstrating fundamental concepts.

## Project Structure
- **baiythieunhi1.py** - Simple conditional statement example (if/else) comparing two variables

## Code Patterns & Conventions

### Language & Style
- Vietnamese comments and variable naming (`a`, `b`, print messages in Vietnamese)
- Simple, procedural Python code style focusing on teaching fundamentals
- No external dependencies or complex frameworks
- Scripts are self-contained and execute from top to bottom

### Execution Pattern
- Each `.py` file is a standalone script meant to be run directly with `python filename.py`
- No function definitions, classes, or modular structure (learning phase)
- Print statements for user output/feedback

## Development Workflow

### Running Scripts
```bash
python baiythieunhi1.py
```

### Expected Output
- Scripts produce text output to console demonstrating the concept
- No file I/O or external data handling

## When Modifying Code
1. Maintain Vietnamese variable names and comments for consistency with learning context
2. Keep examples simple and focused on one concept per file
3. Add clear output messages to demonstrate program execution
4. Test scripts by running them directly with Python interpreter

## Notes
- This appears to be an educational codebase for learning basic Python concepts
- Focus on clarity and simplicity over optimization
- Each file should be independently runnable and demonstrate a single programming concept
